Atomic Hydrogen Properties of AGN Host Galaxies: Spectroscopic imaging results and HI data of the NUGA survey.

This repository contains spectroscopic imaging data and results of the NUGA survey as published in
"Atomic Hydrogen Properties of AGN Host Galaxies: HI in 16 NUclei of GAlaxies (NUGA) Sources" - S. Haan et al. 2008, The Astronomical Journal, 135, 232H

Please see HI-NUGA-results.pdf for more details about the survey results and the data description.
The HI data have been obtained with the NRAO Very Large Array (VLA) over multiple configurations (BCD). There are three images for each of the 16 galaxies: 1) mom0 - gas distribution, 2) mom1 - velocity field, and 3) mom2 - HI velocity dispersion field.
